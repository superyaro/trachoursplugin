[High priority]

* RSS and iCal links for hours

* other export formats (csv, tsv, etc)

* reports, as desired:
    a) Display hours logged & estimated hours by milestone.
    b) Display hours logged by user.
    c) Run reports for arbitrary time periods.
    d) Allow export of hours logged (tab delimited text or other)

[Discussed but low priority]

* hours could have types that could be queried on;  types would be
  selected via checkbox in the /query interface

* tickets could have a sidebar type item that enables adding of hours
  and maybe also displays recent hours on the ticket

* ability to clock on/clock off for tickets, a la the WorkLog plugin: 

* trac has a SVN post-commit script that will close or annote tickets based on the commit message;  it would be useful to modify this to annote hours to a ticket.  That is something like, if the commit message says:

"developing build infrastructure [2.5 hours:#14]"

this would add 2.5 hours to the counter in ticket #14.  
the hours description could just be the commit message.


[Not yet discussed]

* a view at /hours/<user name> could give the summary of hours logged
  by <user name> irrespective of tickets;  maybe this is redundant
  with the /hours view

* once uploaded to trac-hacks, include in http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TimeTracking
